        <p>
        I would like to recommend <b>{{student.name}}</b> for admission to the graduate program at your university.
            I have known {{student.name}} for about {{student.years_taught}} now as an undergraduate student
            in {{student.std.program}} engineering. I have taught him courses on student.courses.
            Moreover, I was the supervisor for his final year project. I taught him

        </p>
   </div>

  <div id="2"  >

        <p >I recall {{student.firstname}} as a sincere and hardworking student. 
            He maintained excellent academic performance throughout his undergraduate 
            ranking among the top percent students of his batch. As an instructor and his supervisor
            too I had enough opportunity is observe his capabilities closely.</p>
            
 </div>

 <div id="3" >

        <p>I was the supervisor in his project titled student/project_title . I was
            quite impressed by his hardworking nature and learning capability.I could observe his keen interest 
            and aptitude for research while working on the project.
            {{student.project}}
            {%if student.paper == 'yes'%}
            In fact, at the end of the project, he was also able to publish a paper.</p>
            {%endif%}
            
        <p>I have noted his {{student.presentation}} presentation skills while he presented his work at our department as well as in the
            conference.
            {%if student.quality1 and student.quality2%}
            I have seen that he has good {{student.quality1}}and also has good {{student.quality2}} qualities.
            {%endif%}
            He is a well-spoken person with a friendly and gentle personality. He is very helpful and cooperative student. He eagerly 
            handed over his project work to his juniors who wanted to further continue the research on the topic along 
            with proper guidance and resources. I have also seen his presentation and communication skills during his 
            project and paper presentations.</p>
            
            {%if student.eca == 'yes'%}
            <p>I appreciate his technical and professional skills. Unlike, most students who limit their project to an 
            academic exercise, he  was also active in extra-curricular activities. Besides academics, he was also 
            involved in several activities in and off the campus. He participated in various hackathons.</p> 
            {%endif%}

        <p>I am quite confident that {{student.firstname}} skills coupled with academic capability will make him a good candidate for 
            your university. Thus, I would highly recommend him for the graduate program at your esteemed 
            university. Please feel free to contact me if further enquiry is required.</p>
